### Gameplay
- Gameplay includes clicking the surroundings of the player to shoot
- Clicking on the player does an AOE attack
- The level restarts if the player dies and highscore is saved
- There is screenshake on bullets and fire rate/ direction keeps changing every random seconds
- The music is unique for every direction the player moves in.
- The main Objective of the game is to Survive


### Stuff learned
- Gamejams are cool
- Learned how to make Synthwave music in FLStudio
- You only make less than half of what you plan in a gamejam
- Devlog / Making of Controlnt (This is very old I could not speak infront of a mic back then): {{< youtube WPWUfntCnW8>}}

### Lore
- This was my first gamejam
- I had made some games with unity, but never made an original game
- A month of progress can be done in a day in a gamejam
- Gamejam is detremental to mental health since crunch is bad
- Submitting early is always beneficial
