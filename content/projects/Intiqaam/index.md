### Lore
- At this point I had some experience with Unity.
- My internship had turned into a fulltime job.
- This did not give me a lot of free time, but there was this one weekend
- I never liked working on hypercasual games. This was my escape 
- Even though I just made a basic interaction system it felt really cool back then
- Due to that I made a youtube tutorial which got a lot of views compared to my other videos
